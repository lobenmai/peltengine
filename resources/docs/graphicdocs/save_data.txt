SAVE DATA
Save data is stored in files with the extension .pokesav.
They are pickled python objects, compressed with the zlib library and written to disk.
The file named error.pokesav is created when the engine crashes and contains a save from that point.
The file named save.pokesav is where the main game save is stored.
