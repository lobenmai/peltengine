THE TOOLS DIRECTORY
Within here are a couple handy programs and experiments.
If a file is not covered in here, assume it's useless. Try and run it if you want, but don't trust it to do anything useful.

Program: animation_view.py
This program displays a part animation. It takes four arguments:
1: the path to the animation file. Note that it must be in the data directory and be relative to the game's directory
2: the name of the animation to show
3: x offset to put the animation at
4: y offset to put the animation at
