TILESETS
The game uses 16x16 pixel tilesets. The images for these are contained in the tilesets directory. Also present is a file detailing tileset animations.

TILESET ANIMATIONS
Tileset animations are specified in the file tileset_anim.xml.
Each tileset has its own <tileset> element which has <cycle> and <tile> elements for animation.

THE <tileset file=> ELEMENT
Contains animations for a specific tileset. It is referenced by its image path.
Contains children <cycle> elements for cycle information.

THE <cycle> ELEMENT
Contains an animation cycle. The first tile frame within the cycle is the tile that will be animated first.

THE <tile pos= time=> ELEMENT
Each tile element has a position attribute, which is the position of the tile in the tilemap in x,y form as well as the time to show in frames.
When a tile is placed in a map which has the same number in the tilemap as the first element in a cycle, it will be cycled with all of the other tiles in the cycle.
