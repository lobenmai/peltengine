FONT DATA
Game fonts are pretty self-explanatory.

At the root is a <font> tag, which contains three attributes:
id: internal ID of the font
height: height of each character
image: image for the font

Within are are a bunch of <letter> tags, which specify a letter.
Each has these attributes:
name: the letter's name. If it is a single character, it can be used as that character in a dialog. If it is multiple, the name is enclosed in {} in order to draw it. Doing this is recommended for non-ASCII characters.
coord: top left coordinate of the letter's image in x,y form.
size: width of the letter in pixels
