DIALOG SCRIPTING INFORMATION
Contains information on scripting dialogs and text.

Display strings are ASCII and contain certain control characters, enclosed with {}.
Any characters in a font that have multiple letters for names are referenced by {}.
For example, displaying pokemon with an accent can be shown with the string Pok{ae}mon.
Certain dialog control commands are also present in {}, which take effect in the <dialog> script command.
Dialogs automatically disappear when they run out of text.

THE {br} COMMAND
Simple enough, creates a line break.

THE {wait} COMMAND
Stops displaying text and waits for the user to press confirm.

THE {tr_wait} COMMAND
Stops displaying text and waits for a transition to complete.

THE {clear} COMMAND
Clears the dialog.

THE {choices} COMMAND
Starts defining a choice dialog.
Option text follows.

THE {endchoice} COMMAND
When after a {choices} command, uses the text before it as a choice for the choice dialog.

THE {endchoices} COMMAND
After an {endchoice} command, stops reading for choices and displays the choice dialog.
